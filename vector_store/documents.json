for transportation, handling and storage Handling at freezing temperature At temperatures below freezing, the product and all installation equip- ment, including the lifting gear, must be handled with extreme care. Make sure that the product is warmed up to a temperature above the freezing point before starting up. Avoid rotating the impeller/propeller by hand at temperatures below the freezing point. The recommended method to warm the unit up is to submerge it in the liquid which will be pumped or mixed. NOTICE: Never use a naked flame to thaw the unit.

unit is still in the condition in which it left the factory - all packing materials are undisturbed - then the acceptable temperature range during transportation, handling and storage is: –50°C (–58ºF) to +60°C (+140ºF). If the unit has been exposed to freezing temperatures, then allow it to reach the ambient temperature of the sump before operating. Lifting the unit out of liquid The unit is normally protected from freezing while operating or im- mersed in liquid, but the impeller/propeller and the shaft seal may freeze if the unit is lifted out of the liquid into a surrounding tempera- ture below freezing. Follow these guidelines to avoid freezing damage: 1. Empty all pumped liquid, if applicable. 2.

below freezing. Follow these guidelines to avoid freezing damage: 1. Empty all pumped liquid, if applicable. 2. Check all liquids used for lubrication or cooling, both oil and water- glycol mixtures, for the presence of unacceptable amounts of water. Change if needed. Water-glycol mixtures: Units equipped with an internal closed-loop cooling system are filled with a mixture of water and 30% glycol. This mixture remains a flowing liquid at temperatures down to –13°C (9°F). Below –13°C (9°F), the viscosity increases such that the glycol mixture will lose its flow properties. However, the glycol-water mixture will not solidify completely and thus cannot harm the product. 2.4 Storage guidelines Storage location The product must be stored in a covered and dry location free

DANGER: Electrical Hazard Before starting work on the unit, make sure that the unit and the control panel are isolated from the power supply and cannot be energized. This applies to the control circuit as well. DANGER: Inhalation Hazard Before entering the work area, make sure that the atmos- phere contains sufficient oxygen and no toxic gases. 4.1.1 Hazardous atmospheres DANGER: Explosion/Fire Hazard Special rules apply to installations in explosive or flammable atmospheres. Do not install the product or any auxiliary equipment in an explosive zone unless it is rated explosion- proof or intrinsically-safe.

If the product is rated explosion- proof or intrinsically-safe, then see the specific explosion- proof information in the safety chapter before taking any fur- ther actions. General requirements These requirements apply: • Use the pump dimensional drawing in order to ensure proper in- stallation. Before installing the pump, do the following: • Provide a suitable barrier around the work area, for example, a guard rail. • Make sure that equipment is in place so that the unit cannot roll or fall over during the installation process. • Check the explosion risk before you weld or use electric hand tools. • Check that the cable and cable entry have not been damaged dur- ing transport. • Always

the size of motor protection breakers and fuses, so that it is sufficient for the specific motor data such as rated current and starting current. It is important that the short-circuit protection is not over-dimensioned. Over-dimensioned fuses and motor protection breakers decrease the protection for the motor. • The fuse rating and the cables must be in accordance with the local rules and regulations. • The fuses and circuit breakers must have the correct rating. The pump overload protection must be connected and set to the rated current. See the data plate and if applicable the cable chart for the rated current. The starting current in direct-on-line start can be up to six times higher than the rated current.

entry gland screw from the stator housing. 2. Remove the stator housing. This provides access to the terminal block/closed end splices. 3. Check the data plate to see which connections are required for the power supply. 4. Arrange the connections on the terminal block/closed end splices in accordance with the required power supply. 5. Connect the mains leads (L1, L2, L3, and ground (earth) ) according to applicable cable chart. The ground (earth) lead must be 50 mm (2.0 in.) longer than the phase conductors in the junction box of the unit. 6. Make sure that the pump is correctly connected to ground (earth). 7.

proof information in the safety chapter before taking any fur- ther actions. NOTICE: Thermal contacts are incorporated in the pump. NOTICE: Thermal contacts must never be exposed to voltages higher than 250 V, breaking current maximum 5 A. 1. If thermal contacts are included in the pump installation, then con- nect the T1 and T2 control conductors to the MiniCAS II monitoring equipment. If the temperature of the pumped liquid is above 40°C (104°F), then do not connect the T1 and T2 leads to thermal contacts. NOTICE: The thermal contacts are incorporated in the stator. Connect them to 24 V over separate fuses to protect other automatic equipment. 2. Connect the mains leads (L1, L2, L3, and ground (earth)) to the start- er equipment.

any plugs while the system is pressurized. Make sure that the pump is isolated from the system and that pressure is relieved before you disassemble the pump, remove plugs, or disconnect piping. Ground continuity verification A ground (earth) continuity test must always be performed after serv- ice. Maintenance guidelines During the maintenance and before reassembly, always remember to perform these tasks: • Clean all parts thoroughly, particularly O-ring grooves. • Change all O-rings, gaskets, and seal washers. • Lubricate all springs, screws, O-rings with grease. During the reassembly, always make sure that existing index markings are in line.

interval Initial in- spection A Xylem-authorized personnel checks the pump condition. From the results, the personnel recom- mends the intervals for the periodi- cal inspection and overhaul for the installation. Within the first year of operation. Periodi- cal in- spection The inspection prevents operational interruptions and machine break- downs. The measures to increase performance and pump efficiency are decided for each application. They can include such things as im- peller trimming, wear part control and replacement, control of zinc-an- odes and control of the stator.

valve is sufficiently short. The self-holding func- tion of the contactor malfunctions. Check: • The contactor connections. • The voltage in the control circuit in relation to the rated voltages on the coil. • The functioning of the stop-level regulator. • Whether the voltage drop in the line at the starting surge causes the contactor's self- holding malfunction. If the problem persists, then contact a sales or authorized service rep- resentative.
